slide #1: Title
	- Let me introduce myself, my name is Pavel, I've been working in machine learning and teaching machine learning for last 6 years. My faivorite field ML is neural networks. Nowdays we call it deep learning. The goal my talk is to give you an idea what deep learning means, why we call it deep and how anyone of you can easily solve problems which 10 years ago were considered as very complicated problems. As example we consider a problem of largescale image search. When we are given with a 



	I came to Dubai just couple of month ago, and I do not know auditory very well. According to forms which were filled by all of you in meetup.com, there are people who learn ML, who already work in ML, but half of you just interested in ML. 
	- So in my talk we will not go deep into mathematics, but 
	- I will tell you how we can acheive
